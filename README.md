# Titanic_Survivor
A neural network to predict whether or not an individual survived the Titanic based on given features.

The training and test sets are taken from the Kaggle competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic). My model achieved 71.3% accuracy in predicting whether the given passengers survived.
